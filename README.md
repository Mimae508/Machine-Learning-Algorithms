Based on a 7-hour lecture on the Introduction fo Keras 2.0 by freeCodeCamp.org

I attempted 5 different groups of simple projects:

1. Linear Regression, Classification, Hidden Markov Model
2. Neural Networks (Fashion Classification) with Tensorflow
3. Deep CV (Cat vs Dog Classification) using CNN, including pretrained model
4. Natural Language Processing with RNNs
5. Reinforcement Learning with Q-Learning
